# ReadMe-UIKit
This app was created based on AMAZING tutorial on [raywenderlich.com - Table Views](https://www.raywenderlich.com/10796666-table-views)
I learned a ton from it! The final result is this app where you can manage a collection of books. You can:
- Add a new book (title, author, review and and image).
- Delete a book.
- Sort books by title or author.
- Move a book
- Manually sort books.

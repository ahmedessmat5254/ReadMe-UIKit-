# ReadMe-UIKit
<p>This app was created based on AMAZING tutorial on [a link](https://www.raywenderlich.com/10796666-table-views)raywenderlich Table Views </a>| I learned a ton from it! The final result is this app where you can manage a collection of books. You can: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new book (title, author, review and and image).</li>
  <li>Delete a book.</li>
  <li>Move a Book.</li>
  <li>Sort books by title or author.</li>
  <li>Manually sort books.</li>
</ul>
